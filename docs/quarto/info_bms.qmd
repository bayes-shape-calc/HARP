title: "Bayesian Model Selection"
---
HARP executes Bayesian model selection (BMS) between an atomic level model ($M_0$) and a residue level model ($M_1$) to compute the probability, $P(M_0 | \mathcal{Y})$, where $\mathcal{Y}$ is the local cryoEM map for a residue., according to

$$
P(M_0 | \mathcal{Y}) = \frac{P(\mathcal{Y} | M_0) P(M_0)}{P(\mathcal{Y} | M_0) P(M_0) + P(\mathcal{Y} | M_1) P(M_1)}
$$
where the priors $P(M_0) = P(M_1) = \frac{1}{2}$, and $P(\mathcal{Y} | M_0)$ and $P(\mathcal{Y} | M_1)$ are the likelihoods that the latent structural information in $\mathcal{Y}$ is explained by an atomic level template (for $M_0$) or a residue level template (for $M_1$), according to Equation 2.2.2. in [Ray, _et al_.](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.2022.0177)

## bms_molecule 
`
harp.bayes_model_select.bms_molecule(grid, data, mol, adfs = None, blobs = None, subgrid_size = 8., sigmacutoff = 5, offset= 0.5, emit = print, chains = None, atom_types = None, atom_weights = None)
`

Run the BMS calculation on an entire molecule by looping over all of the residues in all of the chains
  - results are per residue but extended for all atoms

Default weights are [.05,1.,1.,1.,2.,2.] for [H, C, N, O, P, S]

Default M0 points are 0.25 -> 1.0 by 10 log10-scaled points

Default M1 points are 0.25 -> 2.8 by 20 log10-scaled points



## Input
```
(grid, data, mol, adfs = None, blobs = None, subgrid_size=8., sigmacutoff=5, offset=.5, emit=print, chains=None, atom_types=None, atom_weights=None)
```

## Output
```
(record_prob_good,record_ln_ev)
```


# bms_residue [function]
`harp.bayes_model_select.bms_residue`
This code does the local residue HARP calculation. It is called by `bms_molecule`; so, you probably don't need to call it 

## Input
```
(grid, data, subresidue, adfs, blobs, subgrid_size=8., sigmacutoff=5, offset=0.5, atom_types=None, atom_weights=None)
```

## Output
```
(record_prob_good, record_ln_ev)
```
